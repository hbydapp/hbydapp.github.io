In order to ensure the stability of HBY and CHE value and better value consensus, and better protect and guarantee the interests of the majority of consensus, believers and shareholders, this detailed rules is specially formulated.',
        nft_5:'1. voluntary lock-in HBY, CHE mainly by the community, other shareholders and rabbit friends as auxiliary voluntary lock-in le donation mentality, donate more donate less follow the voluntary principle, early HBY 10 billion as a unit lock-in, CHE as a unit. There is no limit on the smart contract DAO.',
        nft_6:'2. Smart contract will implement DAO management mechanism when it goes online. All voluntary lock-up believers agree that: when the HBY price reaches 1 YUAN/RMB, the lock-up will be released by 0.5% per month, and the right to use the assets shall be the person participating in the transfer to the wallet address. CHE price reaches 1 million yuan/piece above 0.5% monthly lock release. It is just a voluntary consensus lock-up mechanism. Data transparency open source on the chain, no one can use the assets. (There is no refund during the process, and no retraction mechanism)',

        nft_12:'Next DAO governance will cast NFT identity rights and interests for believers at different levels, and voluntary lockups will be released (using the activation mechanism of prophecy machine). The amount of NFT obtained by voluntary lockups will also be different. Not only give rabbit friend identity certificate, but also can enjoy part of the bonus according to rabbit ecology. It can also dispel the concerns of the players who may enter the next stage. It is also the magic pin of the community to stabilize the sea (locking the warehouse without moving). At the same time, it really achieves the autonomy of DAO, forcing the sudden wealth by consensus and creating huaxi Village on the chain of common prosperity.',
